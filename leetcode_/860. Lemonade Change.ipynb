Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a <code>$5</code>, <code>$10</code>, or <code>$20</code> bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays <code>$5</code>.</p>\n",
